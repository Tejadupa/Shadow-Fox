Visualization Library Documentation: Pandas & Seaborn

This repository contains my submission for the Shadowfox Beginners Level Task, where I explore data visualization in Python using Pandas and Seaborn. The documentation highlights the core concepts, features, example implementations, and a comparative study of these two widely used libraries.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Data visualization is a vital step in the data analysis process. This project focuses on two powerful tools:

Pandas: A flexible data analysis library that also provides simple, built-in plotting functions for quick exploration.

Seaborn: A high-level visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed for creating visually appealing and statistically meaningful graphics.
